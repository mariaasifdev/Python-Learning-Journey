| Data Type               | Mutable?    | Explanation                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------  |
|    str    (String)      |   Immutable | Once created, you can’t change it               |
|    bool    (Boolean)    |   Immutable | `True` / `False` values can’t change            |
|    list                 |   Mutable   | You can add, remove, or modify items            |
|    tuple                |   Immutable | Once created, it can’t be changed               |
|    set                  |   Mutable   | You can add or remove elements                  |
|    dict    (Dictionary) |   Mutable   | You can add, update, or delete key-value pairs  |

--> Python Collections (Arrays) <--
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

--> IMPORTANT <--
When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.

--> Python Conditions and If statements <--
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
